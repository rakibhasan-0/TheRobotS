Java Robot Navigation Project

A GUI-based Java project that features three types of robots: Random Robot, Memory Robot, and Right Hand Robot. Each robot has a unique way of navigating the maze to reach 
the goal. 

Robots:

    Random Robot:
        Follows a random path in the maze.
        It will never backtrack to the previous step.

    Memory Robot:
        Remembers the steps it has taken.
        Will never repeat a path it has already traversed.

    Right Hand Robot:
        Always keeps a wall on its right-hand side to navigate.
        Designed to follow the wall and eventually find an exit if there is one.
